    "In this lesson, we will introduce using instance variables, which we use to store information about a particular instance object. We use instance variables as another tool to help us model our object oriented solutions after real-world contexts. So, while we may have a class that is modeled after a School, we have many schools. Things that differentiate schools are the `number_of_students`, `average_class_size`, `city`, etc. These all represent information about a particular school, just as instance variables represent information about a particular instance object.

Local varibles have local or function scope, that is that they are only able to be accessed inside the function in which they are defined. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the file.
